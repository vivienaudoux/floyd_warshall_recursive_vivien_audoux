# Floyd Warshall Algorithm

This repository contains a recursive implementation of the Floyd Warshall Algorithm in Python, along with a unit test using Python's built-in `unittest` library. The algorithm finds the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights, but no negative cycles.

## Files

1. `floyd_warshall_recursive.py` - Contains the implementation of the Floyd Warshall Algorithm.
2. `floyd_warshall_recursive_unittest.py` - Contains a unit test for the Floyd Warshall Algorithm using the `unittest` library.
3. `README.md` - This file, which provides an overview of the repository and its contents.

## Usage

1. Implement the Floyd Warshall Algorithm in a Python script, such as `floyd_warshall_recursive.py`.
2. Write a unit test for the algorithm in a separate Python script, such as `floyd_warshall_recursive_unittest.py`.
3. To run the unit test, navigate to the directory containing the test script and execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python floyd_warshall_recursive_unittest.py
